HW 13: E-Market (Back End)

Back end coding for a server storing category, product, and tag information for items in an online market database. Data can be created, edited, viewed, and removed.

Usage:

Once the file is open, run `npm i` to install the requisite files.

Start server using the command `node server.js` in the terminal.

NOTE 
Error message when starting the server as follows: `Dialect needs to be explicitly supplied as of v4.0.0`

Unsure of where the issue is occuring from at present. Cannot screencast a walkthrough seeing as the server does not work.
